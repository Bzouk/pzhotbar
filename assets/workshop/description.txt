[h1] Hot bar mod v2 [/h1]
Hi everybody, 

This is new version of my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2434425002] old mod [/url] The functionality is essentially the same.
[h3]Do not use the old and new mod at the same time. !!![/h3]

New stuff:
- Code is in Typescript and then it's transcribed into Lua. Thank to [url=https://github.com/asledgehammer/PipeWrench-Template]PipeWrench[/url]
- Same info panel about the item as in the inventory when hover over slot.
- Hide delete button option
- The mod imports settings from the old mod. (Old file name:bzhotbar.ini, new file name: pzhotbar.ini)
- no HYPHEN in mod ID

[h2] Same old description[/h2]

This mod adds quick access bar for items from player inventory. The main reason I made this mod is because I'm lazy to go through the inventory and look for one item that I just need. Mod idea is based another mod [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=503645367] Hotbar for 5-20 often-used [/url] and also other games (Wow EFT etc.). Mod is also using library "Blindcoders Modding Utility".

[b] PZ: build 41 - singleplayer[/b]

The basic version of mod have one bar with 1 row and 8 columns. You can drag bar around. Bar is using same windows like inventory page (X for hide and pin for collapsable window).
Also you can use [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2169435993]Mod Options[/url] to add more quick access bars. With modoptions mod you can set number of bars from 1 to 5. How many rows and columns for each bar will have. Also default key for toggle bars can be changed with modoptions ( default: tab )


[h2] Usage[/h2]
Pres "tab" for show/hide bars. Drag and drop item into slot. You dont need to have item in inventory to add it to slot. Slot counts non broken items in inventory ( number in slot example: (24) items in inventory  and in all containers that you have on you ( even in containers in containers like bandage in medkit in backpack))

Broken items are iqnored, you have to go into inventory to work with them.

[u]Right click[/u]: Same like in inventory window.

[u]Left click[/u]  have smart functions based on item in slot. Functions are using code already in project zomboid. Many function return used item into original container.


Example:
[code]
1) Click slot with Disinfectant ( item is inside medkit in backpack)
2) Disinfectant is moved to main inventory if needed
3) Disinfectant is used on damaged parts
4) Disinfectant is moved inside medkit in backpack if still exist.
[/code]
Note: If you cancel action, item will remain in main invetory (start running etc.).

- Food
  This works like double click in inventory (Cola, Chips, Cigarettes)
  If food is non posion eat half or use whole if cigarettes ( need lighter :-) ) etc.
  After use item returns to original container.

- Water
  If item contain water, player is thirsty and water is not tainted then drink.
  After use item returns to original container.
