# BzoukPzHotBarNew

## Description
This is new version of my old mod. The functionality is essentially the same. 
Do not use the old and new mod. !!!

New stuff:
- Code is in Typescript and then it's transcribed into Lua. Thank to [PipeWrench](https://github.com/asledgehammer/PipeWrench-Template).
- Same info panel about the item as in the inventory
- Hide delete button
- The mod imports settings from the old mod. (Old file name:bzhotbar.ini, new file name: pzhotbar.ini)
- no HYPHEN in mod ID

##  Same old description

This mod adds quick access bar for items from player inventory. The main reason I made this mod is because I'm lazy to go through the inventory and look for one item that I just need. Mod idea is based another mod [Hotbar](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=503645367 ) for 5-20 often-used  and also other games (Wow EFT etc.). Mod is also using library "Blindcoders Modding Utility".

Mod ID: pzhotbar
Workshop ID:
